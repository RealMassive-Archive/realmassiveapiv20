RealMassive API Documentation Layout

# Introduction
Our mission at RealMassive is to open up Commercial Real Estate (CRE) data. We've developed the first fully open CRE API to help application developers build modern apps. Our API gives you real-time access to our nationwide database of CRE listings and related information about this $15.2 trillion industry.

With the RealMassive API you can:
  * Programmatically upload, manage, and syndicate your organization's inventory and availabilities.
  * Quickly and flexibly search tens of thousands of listings from CRE brokerages nationwide.
  * Create, share, and manage your market surveys or favorites lists.

Our documentation is broken down into three sections:
  1. Quickstart: Make your first API calls in less than 5 minutes.
  1. Detailed Guides: Commonly encountered tasks of varying complexity explained.
  1. API Reference: In-depth detail about each of the 400+ endpoints.

# Five Minute Quickstart
## Basic Concepts
The RealMassive API is a [RESTful API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) that communicates over the [HTTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) and adheres to the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification.
  * **Root Endpoints**:
    - **Staging/Testing**: [https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/](https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/)
    - **Production**: [https://api.realmassive.com/](https://api.realmassive.com/)
  * **Authentication Required for all API Requests**:
    - Authenticate requests by setting the HTTP "Authorization" header to "Bearer YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN":

      ```
      > curl -XPOST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN" https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/spaces?page[limit]=1
      ```

    - To get your access token, create a user on [rm-api-sandbox](https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/) and/or a production [realmassive.com](https://api.realmassive.com/) and login that user.
    - To login your user, using basic auth, POST your credentials to the `/login` route on the proper root endpoint (ie. sandbox or production). For example:

        ```
        > curl -XPOST -i -u 'testuser1234:abcd1234!' https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/login
        ```

    Our reponse to your successful login request is a JSON payload containing your access token. Store and send us that token in the Authorization header as mentioned above.
    - You can now make authenticated calls to our API. This call should return successfully:

      ```
      > curl -XPOST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN" https://rm-api-sandbox.appspot.com/spaces?page[limit]=1
      ```
